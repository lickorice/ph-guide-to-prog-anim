# Manim Animations Repository

### This is the animation files repository for [A Filipino's Guide to Programming](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRBUyvh6wWhEKZ4I9VH8mQz3YB8lRprAS).

## What is Manim?

[manim (3Blue1Brown's animation engine)](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) is **not for novice programmers.** I will not provide any tutorial on how to do this, but feel free to browse my animation files for the episodes.

I use the **[Community Edition for manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/)**. I trust you can handle rendering these videos yourself.

## Can I use this?
Yup. No worries on using it anywhere, even commercially. No need to credit me.
